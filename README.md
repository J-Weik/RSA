# / ! \ WARNING Elliptic Curve Decryption is broken
# Program for encoding and cracking RSA encrpytion for relatively small keys.
## Features
### Encrypt
Take an exponent e, two prime Numbers p and q and a message and compute the encrypted message.
### Crack
Given an exponent e and a public Key n tries to compute the private Key d. If found, be able to decode given messages.
### Other
